NecroWeaponTemplateHelper

converts necrodancer's weapon template sprites to a format thats easier to edit, and converts that format back into necrodancer's format


use instructions:

click 'open file browser', then point it to the file you'd like to convert. 

if you're on mac, you can drag your image from a finder window into the file browser to quickly select it.


most of the time, using auto-detect will work. if it fails for some reason, you can choose manually:

to convert from necrodancer's format to this program's format, select 'game to split'.

to convert from this program's format to necrodancer's format, select 'split to game'.

to convert from an image that only contains the first frame of a weapon sprite to this program's format, select 'template to split'.
